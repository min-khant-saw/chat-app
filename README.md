# Chat App Documentation

This document outlines the features and technologies used in the development of a chat application using the MERN stack.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB** - A NoSQL database used to store user information and chat data
- **ExpressJS** - A web framework used for server-side development
- **ReactJS** - A JavaScript library used for client-side development
- **NodeJS** - A JavaScript runtime used for server-side development
- **Socket.IO** - A library for real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication

## Features

### Login and Register System

The chat app will have a login and registration system for users to create an account and access the chat features. Users will be required to provide their email and password to register, and login with their credentials to access the app. Passwords will be securely stored using bcrypt hashing.

### Online/Offline System

The app will allow users to see the status of other users (online/offline). The system will use Socket.IO to update the status of users in real-time.

### Emoji Support

The chat app will support emojis to make conversations more fun and engaging. The app will use a third-party emoji library to provide a wide range of emojis to choose from.

### Sending Images

The chat app will allow users to send images to each other in addition to text messages. Images will be stored on the server and accessed via a URL.

### Good Security

The chat app will implement good security practices to protect user data. Passwords will be hashed using bcrypt, and the app will use HTTPS to secure communication between the server and client.

## Implementation Details

### Server-Side Development

- The server will be developed using Node.js and Express.js.
- The server will connect to a MongoDB database to store user data and chat history.
- Socket.IO will be used to enable real-time communication between clients.

### Client-Side Development

- The client will be developed using React.js.
- The client will use Socket.IO to communicate with the server in real-time.
- The app will use a third-party emoji library to support emojis.
- Images will be uploaded to the server and accessed via a URL.

## Conclusion

This document outlines the features and technologies used in the development of a chat application using the MERN stack. The app will have a login and registration system, online/offline system, emoji support, sending images, and good security practices to protect user data. The server will be developed using Node.js and Express.js, while the client will be developed using React.js. Socket.IO will be used to enable real-time communication between clients.
